# Open-Source BGP Configuration Labs

This repository contains _netlab_ topology files for a series of hands-on labs that will help you master numerous aspects of VXLAN and EVPN technologies on a platform of your choice[^PC]. You can run them on [your laptop](https://netlab.tools/install/ubuntu-vm/) (including [Apple silicon](https://blog.ipspace.net/2024/03/netlab-bgp-apple-silicon.html)), on a [local server](https://netlab.tools/install/ubuntu/), in the [cloud](https://netlab.tools/install/cloud/), or in a (free) [GitHub codespace](https://bgplabs.net/4-codespaces/).

The labs cover:

**VXLAN Configuration**

* [Configuring a single VXLAN segment](vxlan/1-single)

See [lab documentation](https://evpn.bgplabs.net/) for more details and the complete list of planned labs.

[^PC]: Some assembly required: while the Arista cEOS or Nokia SR Linux containers are easy to download, you might have to build a Vagrant box or a Docker container image for your platform.
