While you can use most of them (with reduced functionality) with any other virtual or physical lab environment, we\u2019ll assume you decided to use netlab ; if you want to set up your lab in some other way, read the Manual Setup section of the BGP Labs documentation. Warning EVPN labs work best with netlab release 25.10 or later (some lab exercises require a more recent netlab release). If you\u2019re using an earlier release, please upgrade with pip3 install --upgrade networklab . Select the Network Devices You Will Work With While I usually recommend FRRouting as the simplest-to-deploy network device, FRRouting does not include data-plane VLAN, VXLAN, or anycast gateway configuration. Configuring underlying Linux devices is too complex for an entry-level VXLAN/EVPN exercise; you\u2019ll be better off using one of the other platforms for which we implemented VXLAN and EVPN functionality. You can run Arista EOS in all netlab -supported virtualization environments (libvirt virtual machines or Docker containers), and if you want to start practicing VXLAN and EVPN with minimum hassle, consider using Arista EOS for all lab devices. While most network devices require an x86 CPU, you can run Arista cEOS or Nokia SR Linux containers on MacBooks with Apple silicon . Tip If you plan to run the labs in free GitHub Codespaces , you MUST use container-based network devices like Arista cEOS or Nokia SR Linux. Furthermore, the device cannot rely on the Linux VXLAN kernel module (FRRouting and VyOS do). Select the Additional Devices in Your Lab Some labs use additional switches \u2013 preconfigured devices with which your switches exchange EVPN routes. You won\u2019t configure those devices, but you might have to log into them and execute show commands. The default setup uses Arista EOS for additional switches; we also generated all the show printouts with Arista EOS. Alternatively, you can use any other device for which we implemented basic VXLAN and EVPN functionality. Additional limitations (should they exist) are listed under the Device Requirements section of individual lab exercises. Select the Virtualization Environment Now that you know which network device to use, check which virtualization environment you can use. Running VXLAN/EVPN labs in a free GitHub Codespace is an excellent starting point, but if you decide to build your own infrastructure, containerlab is easier to set up than libvirt . If you want to run the labs on your laptop (including Macs with Apple silicon ), create a Ubuntu VM to run netlab . You could also run them in a VM in a private or public cloud or invest in a tiny brick of densely packed silicon ( example ). Now for a few gotchas: Your hardware and virtualization software (for example, VirtualBox or VMware Fusion) must support nested virtualization if you want to run virtual machines on that Ubuntu VM. You don\u2019t need nested virtualization to run Docker containers unless you\u2019re using containers that run virtual machines within a container (the vrnetlab approach ). Software Installation Based on the choices you made, you\u2019ll find the installation instructions in one of these documents: Using GitHub Codespaces Ubuntu VM Installation on Windows or MacOS Ubuntu Server Installation Running netlab on any other Linux Server Running netlab in a Public Cloud Running netlab on Apple silicon Once you have completed the software installation, you have to deal with the stupidities of downloading and installing network device images ( libvirt , containers ) unless you decided to use Nokia SR Linux or Vyos. I would love to simplify the process, but the networking vendors refuse to play along. Even worse, their licenses prohibit me from downloading the images and creating a packaged VM with preinstalled network devices for you 1 . Fortunately, you only have to go through this colossal waste of time once. Setting Up the Labs We finally got to the fun part \u2013 setting up the labs. If you\u2019re not using GitHub Codespaces: Select a directory where you want to have the VXLAN/EVPN labs Clone the evpn GitHub repository with git clone https://github.com/bgplab/evpn.git . GitHub UI gives you other options in the green Code button, including Download ZIP After you get a local copy of the repository: Change the directory to the top directory of the cloned repository 2 . Verify the current project defaults with the netlab defaults --project command: $ netlab defaults --project device = eos (project) groups.external.device = eos (project) provider = clab (project) If needed, change the project defaults to match your environment with the netlab defaults --project _setting_=_value_ command or edit the defaults.yml file with a text editor like vi or nano . For example, use these commands to change your devices to Cisco Nexus OS running as virtual machines 3 : $ netlab defaults --project device=nxos The default setting device is already set in project defaults Do you want to change that setting in project defaults [y/n]: y device set to nxos in /home/user/evpn/defaults.yml $ netlab defaults --project provider=libvirt The default setting provider is already set in netlab,project defaults Do you want to change that setting in project defaults [y/n]: y provider set to libvirt in /home/user/evpn/defaults.yml In a terminal window, change the current directory to one of the lab directories (for example, basic/1-single ), and execute netlab up .

Those solutions lacked a control plane; you had to manually configure the remote VTEPs, and the VXLAN-based network relied on data-plane learning to establish the mapping between MAC addresses and VTEPs. In this lab exercise, you\u2019ll add EVPN control plane (another BGP address family) to the VXLAN network: Device Requirements You can use any device supported by the netlab OSPF , BGP , and VLAN configuration modules. The device should support VXLAN and EVPN. Start the Lab Assuming you already set up your lab infrastructure : Change directory to evpn/1-bridging Execute netlab up Log into lab devices with netlab connect and verify that the IP addresses and OSPF and BGP routing protocols are properly configured. Existing Device Configuration The switches in your lab (S1 and S2) are preconfigured with a tenant VLAN with VLAN tag 100. IPv4 addresses are configured on Linux hosts, switch loopback interfaces, and the interswitch link ( details ). The switches run OSPF in area 0 across the interswitch link ( details ). The switches have an IBGP session between their loopback interfaces. The IBGP session is currently configured to exchange IPv4 prefixes ( details ). Configuration Tasks Configuring a VXLAN segment with EVPN control plane is a multi-step process: Configure the VXLAN interface (VTEP) and map the VLAN 100 into VXLAN VNI 100100. Do not configure the ingress replication (flooding) list. You\u2019ll find the detailed instructions in the Extend a Single VLAN Segment with VXLAN lab exercise. Enable the EVPN address family on the IBGP session. This should be as simple as selecting the correct address family in the BGP configuration and activating the configured neighbors. Configure an EVPN MAC-VRF instance (the crux of this lab exercise). Tip RFC 7432 (BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN) defines EVPN instances (independent MAC forwarding tables) and three types of EVPN instances (VLAN-based, VLAN bundle, and VLAN-aware bundle). RFC 9469 (Applicability of Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) to Network Virtualization over Layer 3 (NVO3) Networks) redefines an EVPN instance as MAC-VRF. On most data center switches, it\u2019s easiest to configure VLAN-based MAC-VRFs; Junos is one of the few exceptions. We\u2019re not concerned with interoperability in this lab exercise; use the EVPN VLAN service that is easiest to configure. The configuration of an EVPN MAC-VRF instance usually requires configuring three parameters: The EVPN route targets (RT) used to import/export MAC routes into/from the MAC-VRF instance. A good default value in simple deployments is BGP-ASN:VLAN-ID ; in our network, that would be 65000:100. The MAC-VRF instance route distinguisher (RD) that makes the MAC-VRF routes globally unique. Each MAC-VRF instance should have a unique route distinguisher 1 ; VTEP-IP:VLAN-ID is a good default. You usually have to tell the device that you want to use EVPN as the control-plane protocol for the VXLAN segment, and that you want the dynamically-learned MAC addresses redistributed into EVPN MAC/IP (type-1) routes. The configuration details vary significantly across different EVPN implementations. On Arista EOS, you have to: Configure a VLAN within the BGP configuration Configure EVPN RT and RD within the BGP VLAN configuration Configure redistribution of learned routes into EVPN within the BGP VLAN configuration FRRouting configuration is similar, but: Uses VNIs (not VLANs) to identify MAC-VRF instances within BGP configuration Specifies redistribution of MAC addresses into EVPN routes within the EVPN address family (applicable to all MAC-VRFs) Nexus OS uses a completely different syntax: MAC-VRF instances are configured for VNI segments (not VLANs) under evpn configuration. The use of the EVPN control plane (to build ingress replication lists and learn MAC-to-VTEP mappings) is configured within the VXLAN interface configuration.

Enable the EVPN address family on the IBGP session. This should be as simple as selecting the correct address family in the BGP configuration and activating the configured neighbors. Configure an EVPN MAC-VRF instance (the crux of this lab exercise). Tip RFC 7432 (BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN) defines EVPN instances (independent MAC forwarding tables) and three types of EVPN instances (VLAN-based, VLAN bundle, and VLAN-aware bundle). RFC 9469 (Applicability of Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) to Network Virtualization over Layer 3 (NVO3) Networks) redefines an EVPN instance as MAC-VRF. On most data center switches, it\u2019s easiest to configure VLAN-based MAC-VRFs; Junos is one of the few exceptions. We\u2019re not concerned with interoperability in this lab exercise; use the EVPN VLAN service that is easiest to configure. The configuration of an EVPN MAC-VRF instance usually requires configuring three parameters: The EVPN route targets (RT) used to import/export MAC routes into/from the MAC-VRF instance. A good default value in simple deployments is BGP-ASN:VLAN-ID ; in our network, that would be 65000:100. The MAC-VRF instance route distinguisher (RD) that makes the MAC-VRF routes globally unique. Each MAC-VRF instance should have a unique route distinguisher 1 ; VTEP-IP:VLAN-ID is a good default. You usually have to tell the device that you want to use EVPN as the control-plane protocol for the VXLAN segment, and that you want the dynamically-learned MAC addresses redistributed into EVPN MAC/IP (type-1) routes. The configuration details vary significantly across different EVPN implementations. On Arista EOS, you have to: Configure a VLAN within the BGP configuration Configure EVPN RT and RD within the BGP VLAN configuration Configure redistribution of learned routes into EVPN within the BGP VLAN configuration FRRouting configuration is similar, but: Uses VNIs (not VLANs) to identify MAC-VRF instances within BGP configuration Specifies redistribution of MAC addresses into EVPN routes within the EVPN address family (applicable to all MAC-VRFs) Nexus OS uses a completely different syntax: MAC-VRF instances are configured for VNI segments (not VLANs) under evpn configuration.

In this lab exercise, you\u2019ll use VXLAN ( overlay network) to extend a single VLAN across an IP-only backbone ( underlay network): Device Requirements You can use any device supported by the netlab OSPF and VLAN configuration modules. The device should support VXLAN with static ingress replication. Start the Lab Assuming you already set up your lab infrastructure : Change directory to vxlan/1-single Execute netlab up Log into lab devices with netlab connect and verify that the IP addresses and the OSPF are properly configured. Existing Device Configuration The switches in your lab (S1 and S2) are preconfigured with a tenant VLAN with VLAN tag 100. IPv4 addresses are configured on Linux hosts, switch loopback interfaces, and the interswitch link ( details ). The switches run OSPF in area 0 across the interswitch link ( details ). Configuration Tasks Configuring VXLAN on a switch is usually a multi-step process: Configure a VXLAN interface ( Vxlan1 on Arista EOS) and assign a local VTEP address (or source interface) to it. You\u2019ll use the loopback IPv4 address as the VTEP address. Optionally, set the VXLAN destination UDP port (the standard IANA-allocated VXLAN UDP port is 4789) To extend a VLAN across an underlay network with VXLAN, you have to: Map a local VLAN to a VXLAN Virtual Network Identifier (VNI) 1 . Arista EOS does the mapping within the VXLAN interface configuration. Configure a flood list (a list of remote VTEPs) for a VXLAN-enabled VLAN or VNI. The flood list is used to propagate copies of Ethernet BUM (Broadcast, Unknown unicast, Multicast) packets to all other VTEPs participating in the same VXLAN segment. The flood list is also configured within the VXLAN interface configuration on Arista EOS. The underlay network should be able to transport 1500-byte overlay IP packets. You should therefore increase the IP MTU size on the underlay links to at least 1550 bytes 2 due to VXLAN encapsulation overhead: 14 bytes for the Ethernet header 8 bytes for the VXLAN header 8 bytes for the UDP header 20 bytes for the outer IPv4 header Verification Try to ping h2 from h1: $ netlab connect h1 ping h2 Connecting to container clab-single-h1, executing ping h2 PING h2 (172.16.0.4): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 172.16.0.4: seq=0 ttl=64 time=5.273 ms 64 bytes from 172.16.0.4: seq=1 ttl=64 time=2.048 ms ^C --- h2 ping statistics --- 2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max = 2.048/3.660/5.273 ms If that ping succeeds, try pinging with the 1500-byte IPv4 packets. The -s parameter of the Linux ping command specifies the payload size. The maximum payload that can fit into a 1500-byte packet is 1472 bytes due to the ICMP header (8 bytes) and the IP header (20 bytes). $ netlab connect h1 Connecting to container clab-single-h1, starting bash h1:/# ping h2 -s 1472 PING h2 (172.16.0.4): 1472 data bytes 1480 bytes from 172.16.0.4: seq=0 ttl=64 time=5.362 ms 1480 bytes from 172.16.0.4: seq=1 ttl=64 time=2.604 ms 1480 bytes from 172.16.0.4: seq=2 ttl=64 time=2.563 ms ^C --- h2 ping statistics --- 3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max = 2.563/3.509/5.362 ms You forgot to change the MTU size on the underlay links if the simple ping succeeds, but the large-packet ping fails.

Optionally, set the VXLAN destination UDP port (the standard IANA-allocated VXLAN UDP port is 4789) To extend a VLAN across an underlay network with VXLAN, you have to: Map a local VLAN to a VXLAN Virtual Network Identifier (VNI) 1 .

The flood list is used to propagate copies of Ethernet BUM (Broadcast, Unknown unicast, Multicast) packets to all other VTEPs participating in the same VXLAN segment. The flood list is also configured within the VXLAN interface configuration on Arista EOS. The underlay network should be able to transport 1500-byte overlay IP packets.
